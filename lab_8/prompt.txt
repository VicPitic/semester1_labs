Objectives
 Work with Python classes
 Develop a more complex application
 Practice test-driven development
 Practice feature-driven development
Deadlines:
 Iteration 1: Week 8
 Iteration 2: Week 9
 Iteration 3: Week 10
General requirements
 Use feature-driven development
 Identify and plan features over 3 iterations, to be presented over three weeks
 each week, a working version of your application must be presented
 each version must have/be accompanied by:
 tests - each function, outside of those in the UI, must be tested
 specifications - each function, outside of those in the UI, must be specified
 documentation: problem statement, feature list, iteration plan and for eachfeature: running scenario (following tabular model from lecture - Lecture 3, Lecture 7)
 Use layered architecture (UI, Controller, Domain, Repository - concepts & examples inLecture 7)
 Validate data: for invalid inputs, the application must print appropriate error messages; useexceptions

The faculty stores information about:
 Students: <student_id>, <name>
 Courses: <course_id>, <name>, <professor>
Create an application that allows:
 Management of the list of students and the list of courses
 Can add, delete and modify student and course
 Can display all students, all courses
 Can search for a student or a course
 Assignment of grades for a given student and a given course - in addition to the grade, thedate the grade was assigned is also kept
 Display reports:
 For a given course, the list of all students and their grades, ordered:
 Alphabetically by name
 By grade
 Top 3 most popular courses (i.e. courses with most students enrolled; a student is
considered enrolled in a course if they have a grade assigned)
 The top 20% students, ordered by their average grade across all courses: you shoulddisplay student name and their average grade

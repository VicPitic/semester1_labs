Objectives
 Work with Python classes
 Understand Python special methods
 Practice exception handling
 Practice TDD
 Practice writing specifications

For problem statements:
 where possible, work with special (magic) methods
 implement tests for all operations.  specify all the methods

Implement a class MyString that behaves like a Python string but only allows lowercasecharacters, and, in contrast to Python's str, allows modifications like changing a character withinastring in place (i.e. MyString is mutable). Operations allowed:
a. Creating a MyString instance
i. a new string from a given sequence of characters
ii. A string of n random characters, if the parameter initialize_with_random=True in __init__; n is a natural number between 1 and 10, possible characters
are the characters of the English alphabet
b. Access an element (a character) from a given position
c. Modify (replace) an element (a character) from a given position
d. Replace k number of occurrences of a substring with another in the string (in-place, does not
return a new string)
e. Insert a character at a specific position in the string; if position is greater than length of string, add at the end
f. Remove all occurrences of a character in the string
 has parameter start: integer representing position at which to start the search, default: 0
 has parameter end: integer representing position at which to end the search, default: length of the string - 1
 raises ValueError if character not in string
g. Return the index of the first occurrence of a substring in the string, -1 otherwise
h. Returning the length (number of characters) in the string

Expected Output: 

# Create a new empty MyString
s = MyString('') #the string is empty
# Create a new MyString from a given str
s1 = MyString('abcd') #content is now: 'abcd'
print(s1)
#Example of displaying information
#abcd
#Character at position 0: a
#Character at position 1: b
#Character at position 2: c

#Create a new MyString with random characters
sr = MyString(initialize_with_random=True)
# assume generated n = 4
# and generated characters 'a', 'k', 'm', 'd'
# content of string is: 'akmd'
# Access and modify a character
print(sr[2]) #'m' (character at index 2)
sr[2] = 'x' #replace 'm' with 'x', content is now: 'akxd

try:
sr[1] = 'A' #Cannot add uppercase character
except TypeError as e:
print(e)
try:
sr[0] = '1' #Cannot add non-letter character
except TypeError as e:
print(e)
# Insert a character
sr.insert(1, 'z') #insert 'z' at index 1, content is now: 'azkxd'
sr.insert(8, 'y') #insert 'y' at the end, since 8>5, content is now:
'azkxdy'
# Remove all occurrences of a character
sr.remove_character('x') # remove 'x', content is now: 'azkdy'
# Replace k occurrences of a substring
s2 = MyString('abcabcabc')
s2.replace('ab', 'xz', 2) # replace first 2 occurrences of 'ab' with
'xy', content is now: 'xzcxzcabc'
# Concatenation
s3 = MyString('lm')
s4 = sr + s3 #content of s4: 'azkdylm' (sr was 'azkdy')
# Repetition
s5 = sr * 2
print(s5) #s5 is now: 'azkdyazkdy'
# Rotate entire string
#content of sr is now: 'azkdy'
sr.rotate(2) #rotate right by 2 positions, content is now: 'dyazk'
# Reverse a substring
#content of sr is now: 'dyazk'
sr.reverse_substring(0, 2) #reverse substring from index 0 to 2,
#content is now: 'aydzk'
# Sliding window of size 3
#content is now: 'aydzk'
#size = 3, overlap = 2
windows = sr.sliding_window(3, 2) #['ayd', 'ydz', 'dzk']
